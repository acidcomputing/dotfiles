# Dotfiles
This is my personal dotfiles repo. It contains my handwritten configuration files for Zsh, shell aliases, htop, kitty and other tools.
Feel free to copy, modify, distribute, or suggest changes. These are config files written for my personal machines.

## Zsh config
My Zsh config includes two main files: `.zshrc`, and `.aliases.zsh`. 
My config is simple, and contains a custom colorscheme. It includes a few quality-of-life tools, options and plugins:
 
- **Git plugin:** Sets a colored prompt with Git branch along with dirty/clean indicators.
- **Syntax highlighting:** Provides syntax highlighting for paths, commands, aliases, and more.
- **Autosuggestions:** Suggests previously executed commands as seen in Kali Linux.
- **Tab Completion:** Provides tab completion with colors, and a menu selection.
- **Aliases:** `ls` aliases from Kali Linux, as well as custom ones :) 

This Zsh configuration is intended for Debian and Arch.

## Pacman config
Basic Pacman config.
- Pacman eating pellets (ILoveCandy)
- Parallel Downloads
- Multilib support.

## Htop config
My `htop` configuration contains a simple config with these elements in the following order:

[Column 1]
- CPU cores (with speed and % usage)
- RAM Usage
- Swap Usage

[Column 2]
- Hostname
- Uptime
- BLANK
- Tasks
- Load Average
- BLANK
- Disk IO
- Network IO
- Battery

## Kitty config
My kitty configuration is simple. It uses `zsh` as its shell and `ctrl + shift` as modifier key.

# Dotfiles
This is my personal dotfiles repo. It contains my Zsh configuration, aliases, and some other things as I add keep working on them.

## Zsh config
My Zsh config includes two main files: `.zshrc`, and `.aliases.zsh`. 
My config aims to stay out of the user's way while being powerful, with a custom colorscheme. It includes a few quality-of-life tools, options and plugins:
 
- **Git plugin:** Sets a colored prompt with Git branch along with dirty/clean indicators.
- **Syntax highlighting:** Provides syntax highlighting for paths, commands, aliases, and more.
- **Autosuggestions:** Suggests previously executed commands as seen in Kali Linux.
- **Tab Completion:** Provides tab completion with colors, and a menu selection.
- **Aliases:** `ls` aliases from Kali Linux, as well as custom ones :) 

This Zsh configuration has been tested on Debian 13. It is not portable, and can't work on BSD or MacOS.
